# Open Graph Image Note

The Open Graph image (`og-image.png`) needs to be created and placed in the `/public` folder.

## Recommended specifications:
- **Size**: 1200x630 pixels
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Content**: 
  - Brand name "Xplore Xperience"
  - Tagline "Discover the Enchanting Northeast India"
  - Stunning Northeast India landscapes (mountains, valleys, monasteries)
  - Modern, premium design

## How to add:
1. Create or obtain a 1200x630px image
2. Save it as `og-image.png` in the `public` folder
3. The meta tags in `index.html` are already configured to use it

## Alternative:
You can use one of your existing travel images temporarily:
- Rename `/public/hero.jpg` to `/public/og-image.png` OR
- Update the og:image meta tags to point to `/hero.jpg`
